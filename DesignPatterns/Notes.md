### When to use the factory pattern?#
- When the type of objects required cannot be anticipated beforehand
- When multiple objects that share similar characteristics need to be created
- When you want to generalize the object instantiation process since the object set up is complex in nature

# When to use the constructor pattern?#
- You can use it when you want to create multiple instances of the same template, since the instances can share methods but can still be different. Some examples of where it can be useful include:
1. libraries
2. plugins
